      <AboutMeText>
        Born and raised in Czech Republic Dutch and Japanese parents, I moved to
        Amsterdam in 2014 to study hospitality management at Hotelschool The
        Hague.
        <br />
        <br />
        After graduating from Hotelschool The Hague I worked different jobs in
        the hospitality industry as a manager, which allowed me to travel and
        live around the world. But when COVID-19 forced me to stay inside I
        finally had some time to re-evaluate my career. <br />
        <br />
        During the pandemic I tried many different online courses, and in the
        summer of 2021 I started the full-stack developer path on Codecademy and
        instantly fell in love with programming. <br />
        <br />
        After a few weeks I decided to enroll myself into Codaisseur where I
        spent 10 intense weeks studying.
        <br />
        <br />
        After graduating I started working for Building Tech Heros as a software
        developer.
